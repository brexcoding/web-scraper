# How it works 
 
this project is a simple python script that gets the data from a html page by providing the url to this page 
say amazon product page as example 
by using  the requests python package to make the http requests  
and using the  BeautifulSoup and the lxml packages to process the html and pages and get the data 
and this data can be the price ,title , availability of the product , by passing the html id attribute in select_one method 

# Why Should I Use This Tech 

this code is handy when it comes to getting data automaticaly 
a use case might be implemented in a ecomerce website to track the availability of a product for example 
so the user do not order a product that is not available "dropshiping case "
